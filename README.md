# Association-of-Wealth-and-depression-using-SAS

Background: Many publications use nationally representative data sources to answer public health questions. For this project, you are to assess the association between wealth (exposure) and depression (outcome) in adults. You’ll make final decisions about how you assess this association.

WEALTH – The definition of wealth is broad and multifaceted. Focusing on data available in NHANES, wealth could be assessed using savings and/or home ownership. Note that this is not the only, or even the best, possible definition of wealth.

1.	Savings of $20,000 or more indicates wealth
2.	Savings between $5,000 and $20,000 is low wealth
3.	Savings $5,000 or less is inadequate wealth 
4.	Home ownership indicates wealth

For this project, we will use the definition: a person must have either $20,000 or greater in family savings and/or own their home to indicate “high” wealth.

DEPRESSION – Depression can be assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a clinically validated tool for screening symptoms of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV. A total score is based on the sum of the points in each item ranging from 0 to 27. Other variables may exist in the data files (e.g., medications) that could also be used to measure depression. 

For this project, a cutoff score of 5 or greater will be used to denote mild to severe depressive symptoms, consistent with Kroenke et al, 2001.

COVARIATES – All projects will include age, race/ethnicity, and sex as confounders. Additionally, all projects will consider income as an effect modifier (less than $20,000 versus $20,000 or more). In addition, you must select at least one additional relevant confounder for inclusion in your analysis based on your conceptual model of the association of interest. 

INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA
•	Inclusion: NHANES participants in the 2015-2016 cycle who completed the interview and were examined in the medical examination centers
•	Exclusion: aged < 20 years.
